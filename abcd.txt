I have been sacrificing my nights for our company for half a month- every month- for 14 continuous months. 

I do not intend to be scrutinized for someone else's non-performance.

I have always met my targets and repeatedly exceeded them. 

I am saddened that a year worth of persistent performance and hard work was trumped by a single rare occurrence of incomplete execution; 

which was a consequence of several factors beyond my actual complete control.
